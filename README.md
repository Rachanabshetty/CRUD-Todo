The Todo List CRUD application supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on todo items. Users can easily add new tasks, view the existing ones, update task details, and delete completed or unnecessary tasks.

Create Todo: Users can add new tasks to their todo list with a title, description, and status (e.g., "completed," "in progress," "not started").
View Todos: The application provides a list of all existing todos, allowing users to get an overview of their tasks.
Update Todo: Users can edit the details of a specific todo, such as modifying the title, description, or updating the status.
Delete Todo: Completed or unwanted tasks can be easily removed from the todo list.

Backend: Developed using the Spring Boot framework, the backend handles the business logic and interacts with a MySQL database to persist todo data.
Database: MySQL is used to store and retrieve todo information, maintaining a structured and organized storage system.
API Testing: Postman is employed for testing the CRUD operations, ensuring the seamless functionality of the backend API.
